## Data Structures & Algorithms II Quices
These are solutions to quices from the Data Structures and Algorithms II course, which was more directly related to graphs and algorithms involving them to solve classical computer science problems. In my case, I solved three posted problems using a *BFS*, a *Dijkstra*, and a *Ford Fulkerson* algorithm, all in **C++**. All these are commented in spanish, I'll get on to changing them to english later. This was made for educational purposes and is licensed under the **MIT License**.
