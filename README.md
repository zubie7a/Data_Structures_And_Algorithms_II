## Data Structures & Algorithms II
These are solutions to quizzes from the **Data Structures and Algorithms II** course, which was more directly related to graphs and algorithms involving them to solve classical computer science problems.

In my case, I solved three posted problems using a *BFS*, a *Dijkstra*, and a *Ford Fulkerson* algorithm, all in **C++**. This was made for educational purposes and is licensed under the **MIT License**.
